## Credits

The HTML and CSS were both provided by The excellent staff at UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Bootcamp. They also provided the JavaScript Skeleton that allowed the DOM manipulation to take place and the beginings of the table of technology used in this README.md. I contributed the bulk of the Javascript which provided the logic for the functioning of the password generator.
