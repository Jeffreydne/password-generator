The user inputs the number of characters &amp; what types of characters are desired in order to get a randomly generated password.

## Code Example

The below JavaScript example shows how I use 

```JS
   
 
```
```JS
  XXXXXXXXXX
  XXXXXXXXXX
  
```
## Usage

This webstie is designed to give any interested party an ability to obtain a randomly generated, strong password, based on their criteria for number of characters, as well as types of characters to use (which can include upper and/or lower case letters as well as numbers and special characters).

## Learning Points

During the making of this portfolio I implemented JavaScript to provide the logic for generating a random, strong password, keeping in mind best practices. 

* XXXXXXX

* XXXXXXX

*  XXXXXXX 

*  XXXXXXX

## Credits

Note: I initially enrolled in the full time Fullstack Bootcamp beginning in September 2023. I began working on this just as I made the decision to transfer into the part time bootcamp that I am in now. I wrote the bulk of the code while waiting for the part time camp to begin, using concepts covered in the full time bootcamp. The HTML and CSS were both provided by The excellent staff at UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Bootcamp. They also provided the JavaScript Skeleton that allowed the DOM manipulation to take place and the beginings of the table of technology used in this README.md. I contributed the bulk of the Javascript which provided the logic for the functioning of the password generator.
